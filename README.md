# About me
Ph.D. of Philosophy, researcher, mathematician, programmer, 
blockchain specialist.

More than 20 years of professional development experience.
My favorite languages: Rust, F#, Go, Haskell etc.

## :hearts: My own favorite development Projects
* [mrLSD/riscv-fs](https://github.com/mrLSD/riscv-fs) - F# RISC-V Instruction Set formal specification.
* [mrLSD/iLang](https://github.com/mrLSD/iLang) - programming language and compiler from scratch with LLVM backend.
  My fun project.  Work in progress.
* [mrLSD/semantic-analyzer-rs](https://github.com/mrLSD/semantic-analyzer-rs.git) - Semantic analyzer library for 
  compilers written in Rust for semantic analysis of programming languages, with code generation for any backend.
  Most useful for creation compilers of programming languages.
