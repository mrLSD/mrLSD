  # About me
- [x] Ph.D. of Philosophy (Kharkiv National University of V.N. Karazin)
- [x] Mathematician (Specialist in Applied Mathematics - Systems control of Spacecrafts and satellites)
- [x] Researcher
- [x] Programmer (Software Engineer)
- [x] Blockchain specialist

More than 20 years of professional development experience.
My favorite languages: Rust, F#, Go, Haskell etc. 

My favorite areas: RISC-V (CPU creation), LLVM (compileres design and implementation), FPGA (hardware design), Blockchain (Ethereum, NEAR Protocol).

## :hearts: My own favorite development Projects
* [mrLSD/swift-evm](https://github.com/mrLSD/swift-evm) - Swift EVM implementation in Swift programming language.
* [mrLSD/riscv-fs](https://github.com/mrLSD/riscv-fs) - F# RISC-V Instruction Set formal specification.
* [mrLSD/iLang](https://github.com/mrLSD/iLang) - programming language and compiler from scratch with LLVM backend.
  My fun project. Work in progress.
* [mrLSD/semantic-analyzer-rs](https://github.com/mrLSD/semantic-analyzer-rs.git) Semantic analyzer library for 
  compilers written in Rust for semantic analysis of programming languages, with code generation for any backend.
  Most useful for creation compilers of programming languages.
* [mrLSD/llvm-lib-rs](https://github.com/mrLSD/llvm-lib-rs.git) LLVM library wrapper for LLVM-C API written in Rust with safety in mind.
